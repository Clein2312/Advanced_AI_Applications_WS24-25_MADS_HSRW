    "- While developing functions, you can:\n",
    "    1. Write the function in a .py file, and (re)load into a notebook if you change it. Note that ray tune can be problematic to run from inside a notebook.\n",
    "    2. Make a hypertune.py file and excecute from the command line. You will never have problems with reloading functions, because that is done every time you start up.\n",
    "- Build your own poetry toml file with caution. Dont add stuff you dont need (e.g. you probably don't need jax, trax, plotly or scikit-learn). It's better to add later on if you miss something that to add too much.\n",

    "- you can't blindly copy paths. If you want to add your own `src` folder for import, you need to figure out if your `src` folder is located at the \"..\" or \"../..\" location, relative to your notebook in your `sys.path.insert(0, \"..\")` command\n",
    "- same goes for datalocations. \"../../data/raw\" might have changed into \"../data/raw\" depending in your setup\n",
    "- While developing functions, you can:\n",
    "    1. Write the function in a .py file, and (re)load into a notebook if you change it. Note that ray tune can be problematic to run from inside a notebook.\n",
    "    2. Make a hypertune.py file and excecute from the command line. You will never have problems with reloading functions, because that is done every time you start up.\n",
    "- Build your own poetry toml file with caution. Dont add stuff you dont need (e.g. you probably don't need jax, trax, plotly or scikit-learn). It's better to add later on if you miss something, than to add everything and get a bulky environment.\n",
    "- PRACTICE linting and formating with the Makefile. Black is simple, mypy takes more effort but you will become a better programmer if you use mypy, and mypy will catch possible errors that dont show up during a first run (but might show up later, with different input) \n",
